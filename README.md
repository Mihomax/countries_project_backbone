# countries_project_backbone

Countries_App  - A quick API based application in order to find and get some info on the country you are interested in.

With the application you can search countries by typing its name or key letters. If there is such country/countries in our planet :) , 
you'll see one or list of your searched countries with its flag, map, and some other important information on them. If you want to know more about that particular country you can directly redirect to wikipedia. You can add your preferred countries to your favorites and then explore them separately in "My favorite countries" section. Also, you can sort your list of countries by population or region. 

Technologies used: backbone.js, require.js, grunt and less. 

Preparation of environment to launch the app:
In order to install and run the app, npm and grunt needed to be installed beforehand, as well as to activate local server...
So run this command in your terminal in order to have them.
1. npm install npm@latest -g,  
2. npm install -g grunt-cli,
3. for the local server, the easiest way for me is just installing "Live Server" from VS Code extentions. Once "Live Server" is installed on the bottom-right part of VS Code pannel you will see "Go Live" button which you'll use later in arder to launch the app.


Installation and launch: (with VS Code): 
Download or clone the repository on your local machine and open it in VS Code.
Being on the root directory (.../.../countries_project_backbone), run this commands in terminal : 
1. npm install (to install all the modules and dependencies),
2. grunt build (to build the apps production version),
3. click on the index.html in build and click "Go live" from VS Code's bottom-right, the page will open automatically...

If you are not using VS Code: 
Follow 1 and 2 steps from your preferred CLI. When your local server is ready, simply put the buid directory on it and launch to index.html.

Bon Voyage!
