# countries_project_backbone
Very beginning of the countries_App with some initial UI and functional API. Done with backbone.js, require.js and less. 
There is no Grunt yet, but it is on the way...

To launch the App local server has to be active, the easiest way for me is just installing "Live Server" from VS Code extentions.
Once "Live Server" is installed you simply open index.html in VS Code and click "Go Live", which is on the bottom-right part of VS Code pannel, page opens automatically...
